Tokens are burnt on every transaction because the burn wallet is also a hodler which receives reflections ([link](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf5b1fd29d23e98db2d9ebb8435e1082e3b38fb65?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead \"https://etherscan.io/token/0xf5b1fd29d23e98db2d9ebb8435e1082e3b38fb65?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead\"))\n-\t**~48%** are in circulation currently it will decrease slowly"

          "value": "A: No they do not. You only get reflections on the chain you are holding your tokens on. The ETH dead wallet benefits from the majority of the reflections as it holds the 52% of the supply and therefore as tokens get taken out of circulation, the price will inevitably move up. Holders on BSC gets more reflections as there is no dead wallet."
